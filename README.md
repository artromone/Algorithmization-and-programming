# Laboratory work 1 semester c++
- `S0` — coding guidelines test

- `I1` — sequences
- `I2` — one-dimensional arrays (built-in and in dynamic memory)
- `I3` — C-style strings
- `I4` — two-dimensional arrays, pointers, top-down approach
- `I5` — recursion (real number check)
- `I6` — Taylor series

- `T1` — geometric shapes: isotropic scaling, polymorphism
